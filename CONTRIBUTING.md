We're always grateful for contributions of any kind (pull requests, bug reports, helping people in our [Google Group][1]). However before you start working on something, please read this document and follow some simple rules.

## Pull requests & coding conventions

Before you start writing code that might introduce non backwards-compatible changes, like renaming core components of our library, please discuss this with us in our [Google Group][1] or as an issue here beforehand. Generally if you work on anything besides a bugfix it is a good idea to talk to us first. We hate that you spent hours on something when we have to deny your pull request for some reasons or it needs to be changed.

Also if you work on code please follow our coding conventions. We're not going to list every item here. Please look at the existing code to get an idea of our style. We're using the default IntelliJ IDEA code style. Eclipse's default code style for instance is a bad example. Never reformat existing code just because it doesn't suite your style!

1. Indent by **four spaces**
2. Opening brace goes in the same line as the statement (like [1TBS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS))
3. Use `final` keyword wherever applicable
4. Document your code (of course!)

If you create new widgets please add them to our [demo](https://github.com/gwtbootstrap3/gwtbootstrap3-demo), too.

Thank you!
